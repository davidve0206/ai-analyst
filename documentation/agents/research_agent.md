# Research Agent Documentation

## Model

Uses GPT-4o-mini; should use GPT-4o due to its reasoning capabilities, but not applied to avoid the cost.

## Tools

The agent coordinates a team of other agents using the [MagenticOne](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/) pattern; according to Microsoft's own webpage "The orchestration is especially well-suited for scenarios where the solution path is not known in advance and may require multiple rounds of reasoning, research, and computation."
