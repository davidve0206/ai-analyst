Retrieve all information necessary to analyze the {{ request.period }} sales for the following {{ request.grouping }}: {{ request.grouping_value }}. At the very least, the information needed is:

    - {{ request.period }} sales data for the {{ request.grouping }}: {{ request.grouping_value }} for the last 3 years.
    - Analysis of the evolution of total sales for the given {{ request.grouping }}, keeping in mind:
      - Month-to-month or Quarter-to-quarter changes and seasonality
      - Year-to-year changes, for example, January 2025 compared to January 2024
    - Separately, an analysis of the key drivers of sales (e.g. top products, regions, or customer segments).
      - In addition to the value for the most recent period, consider also the {{ request.period }} evolution of these drivers over time
    - Visualizations and projections to illustrate trends and forecast future performance.
      - At the very minimum, include a {{ request.period }} projection of sales for the {{ request.grouping }}: {{ request.grouping_value }}
      - Share the name of the files generated, as well as a description of the plot and the data points included.

Use all available internal data, and share as much relevant data as you can find; it is better to have too much information than too little.

The target is an in-depth insights, not just summary metrics — go beyond the numbers to explain what’s happening and why.

Always start the analysis with Total Sales level data, and only after you understand the Sales behaviour, move onto understanding the details, such as the behaviour of exact products sold.
