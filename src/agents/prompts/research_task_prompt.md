Today is {date}.

We are analysing the {periodicity} sales data for data for {grouping} - {grouping_value}, but we have found that due to the following reason, we need to perform a more in-depth analysis:

{special_case_reason}

Your task is to try to retrieve additional information, perform an analysis on the reasons for this behaviour and extract actionable insights on how to correct this. For example, retrieving the sale history by client for this {grouping} and analysing if this any particular client has had a change in behaviour.

For this, you can only use the company's detailed sales data, which you can find in the file {internal_data_file_name}, which contains {data_description}

This is the only company information you have access to.

The following analysis has already been performed:

{sales_history}

{sales_analysis}

{sales_operational_data}

Your insights need to increase the level of detail of these analysis. such as adding historical values and changes to the last period, do not stop until you have new insights, and those insights are actionable.
