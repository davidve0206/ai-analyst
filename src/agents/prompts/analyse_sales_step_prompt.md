Today is {date}.

Perform an in-depth analysis of the {periodicity} sales history data, net of discounts, for {grouping} - {grouping_value}. Identify trends, patterns, and insights that can be derived from the data. Provide all of your findings in a structured format.

The sales data can be found at {input_location}; you can update this file by adding columns for your analysis, or create new files as needed.

You should at least include in your analysis one projection for the next 3 months. You should use as much available data as you can to perform this projection. First, describe the existing data, then based on that, decide how much data to use for the projection.

Focus your analysis on the last period of data available in {input_location}, but highlight any interesting trends in the most recent 3 to 6 months of data.
