You have made several attempts to solve the problem but are not making progress.

Stop trying to solve the task. **Do not call any tools, do not generate new code.**

Instead, provide a clear and complete diagnostic summary that includes:

1. **What You Tried**
   - Briefly summarize all major strategies, code, or analyses attempted so far.

2. **What You Know**
   - Describe the relevant information currently available to you (e.g. known inputs, provided files, created files, known structure of the data, clarified goals).

3. **Whatâ€™s Missing or Blocking Progress**
   - Identify what key information is missing, ambiguous, or preventing you from progressing.
   - Be explicit and structured about what's unclear or contradictory or just does not exist within the files provided.

4. **Suggested Next Steps**
   - Propose what the system could clarify, provide, or change in order to allow progress.

Be precise, objective, and complete. The goal is to hand off a clear status report so another agent or a human can pick up where you left off.
