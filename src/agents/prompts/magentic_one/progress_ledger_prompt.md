Recall we are working on the following request:

{task}

And we have assembled the following team:

{team}

To make progress on the request, please answer the following questions, including necessary reasoning:

    - Is the request fully satisfied? (True if complete, or False if the original request has yet to be SUCCESSFULLY and FULLY addressed)
    - Are we in a loop where we are repeating the same requests and / or getting the same responses as before?
      - Loops can span multiple turns, and can include repeated actions like requesting the same information more than 2 times in a row.
    - Are we making forward progress? (True if just starting, or recent messages are adding value. False if recent messages show evidence of being stuck in a loop or if there is evidence of significant barriers to success such as the inability to read from a required file)
    - Who should speak next? (select from: {team_names})
    - What instruction or question would you give this team member? (Phrase as if speaking directly to them, and include any specific information they may need)
