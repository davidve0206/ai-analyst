As a reminder, we are working to solve the following task:

{task}

It's clear we aren't making as much progress as we would like, but we may have learned something new. Please rewrite the following fact sheet, updating it to include anything new we have learned that may be helpful.

Example edits can include (but are not limited to) adding new guesses, moving educated guesses to verified facts if appropriate, etc.

Updates may be made to any section of the fact sheet, and more than one section of the fact sheet can be edited. This is an especially good time to update educated guesses, so please at least add or update one educated guess or hunch, and explain your reasoning.

Here is the old fact sheet:
