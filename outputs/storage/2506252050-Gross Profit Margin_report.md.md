### **Executive Summary**  
The Gross Profit Margin KPI, which measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold, displayed significant fluctuations over the last three fiscal years. As of Q3 2025, the Gross Profit Margin reached **-73.87%**, a marked decline from the previous period's margin of **3.49%** in Q3 2024. This deterioration suggests urgent attention is required to address the underlying factors contributing to decreased profitability.

### **Overview**  
For the most recent quarter, Q3 2025, the Gross Profit Margin is reported at **-73.87%**, a stark contrast to **3.49%** recorded in Q3 2024. The findings indicate that while revenue for Q3 2025 was **$4,970,932.65**, the cost of goods sold soared to **$49,709,932.65**, leading to a substantial decline in profitability. Comparatively, Q3 2024 witnessed a stable revenue stream and effective cost management, contributing to a positive margin.

The factors influencing these shifts are likely tied to significant drops in sales volume, rising costs, and potential inefficiencies in procurement and inventory management. For instance, in Q3 2025, operational metrics indicated a lower quantity sold (270,036) and a higher cost of goods sold (around $49.7 million), which further exacerbated the decline in Gross Profit Margin.

These findings warrant immediate action to reassess operational strategies, focusing on cost management and enhancing sales driver mechanisms to stabilize and improve the Gross Profit Margin moving forward.
