COMPANY_DESCRIPTION = """
Wide World Importers (WWI) is a wholesale novelty goods importer and distributor
operating from the San Francisco bay area.

As a wholesaler, WWI's customers are mostly companies who resell to individuals.
WWI sells to retail customers across the United States including specialty stores,
supermarkets, computing stores, tourist attraction shops, and some individuals.
WWI also sells to other wholesalers via a network of agents who promote the products
on WWI's behalf. While all of WWI's customers are currently based in the United States,
the company is intending to push for expansion into other countries/regions.

WWI buys goods from suppliers including novelty and toy manufacturers, and other
novelty wholesalers. They stock the goods in their WWI warehouse and reorder from
suppliers as needed to fulfil customer orders. They also purchase large volumes
of packaging materials, and sell these in smaller quantities as a convenience for
the customers.
