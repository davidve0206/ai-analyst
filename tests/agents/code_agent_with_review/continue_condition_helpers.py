finalized_text = """Below is a structured, in-depth analysis of Spain’s net-of-discount monthly sales history (Jan-2021 through Nov-2023), including growth metrics, seasonality, recent trends, and a three-month linear projection. All supporting data have been saved in:

- **spain_sales_history_with_metrics.csv** (original data + Month, Sales, MoM_Growth, YoY_Growth)  
- **spain_sales_projection.csv** (linear forecast for Dec-23, Jan-24, Feb-24)

---

1. Data Overview  
• Time span: Jan 2021 – Nov 2023 (30 monthly observations)  
• Key column: “SALES_FUNCTIONAL_CURRENCY” (renamed “Sales” for brevity), values in functional currency.  
• New columns added:  
 – Month (datetime)  
 – MoM_Growth (%) = (Salesₘ – Sales₍ₘ₋₁₎)/Sales₍ₘ₋₁₎  
 – YoY_Growth (%) = (Salesₘ – Sales₍ₘ₋₁₂₎)/Sales₍ₘ₋₁₂₎  

2. Overall Metrics & Trend  
• Average monthly sales (all data): ~ 4.13 million  
• Median monthly sales: ~ 3.89 million  
• Min/Max sales: 2.50 M (Oct 2023) / 5.85 M (Apr 2021)  
• Linear trend (1st-degree fit):  
 – Slope ≈ –2,900 per month (small downward drift)  
 – Intercept ≈ 3.86 M at “month-zero”  
• Implication: Over the past 30 months, sales have been essentially flat to slightly declining.

3. Growth Analysis  
• Average MoM growth: +1.8% (stdev ~ 34%) → high volatility month-to-month  
• Average YoY growth (available after 12 months): +2.5% (stdev ~ 40%) → also highly seasonal  
• Largest MoM increases:  
 – May 2023 +80.5%  
 – Aug 2023 +78.9%  
 – Jan 2023 +56.7%  
• Largest MoM declines:  
 – Apr 2023 –45.5%  
 – Oct 2023 –34.1%  
 – Jul 2023 –34.2%  
• Largest YoY surges:  
 – Aug 2023 +91.1%  
 – May 2023 +36.5%  
 – Sep 2023 +28.0%  
• YoY dips:  
 – Dec 2022 –50.2%  
 – Oct 2023 –30.7%  
 – Nov 2023 –11.6%

4. Seasonality & Anomalies  
• Recurring peaks around spring (Mar–May) and late summer (Jul–Aug).  
• Recurring troughs in Apr and Oct each year.  
• Notable outliers:  
 – Apr 2021 spike (5.85 M) followed by Apr 2022 dip (3.10 M)  
 – Aug 2023 outlier high (5.49 M) with +91% YoY — possibly a one-off promotion or market event.

5. Recent 6-Month Detail (Jun–Nov 2023)

| Month    | Sales (M) | MoM (%) | YoY (%)  |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Jun 2023 | 4.665     | –0.7    | –4.4     |
| Jul 2023 | 3.069     | –34.2   | +1.9     |
| Aug 2023 | 5.490     | +78.9   | +91.1    |
| Sep 2023 | 3.796     | –30.9   | +28.0    |
| Oct 2023 | 2.503     | –34.1   | –30.7    |
| Nov 2023 | 3.780     | +51.0   | –11.6    |

Interpretation: extreme swings suggest promotional pushes or holidays drive sharp up-and-down moves. The last two months show a rebound in Nov (+51% MoM) but still below last year’s Nov.

6. Three-Month Linear Projection  
(using all 30 months, 1st-degree polynomial)
  
| Month      | Projected Sales (M) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Dec 2023   | 3.817               |
| Jan 2024   | 3.811               |
| Feb 2024   | 3.804               |

Caveat: a pure linear fit smooths out seasonality and may understate the spring/summer spikes. Use as a baseline.

7. Key Insights & Recommendations  
• Sales are highly seasonal with repeatable peaks/troughs; any forecast or budget should explicitly model seasonality (e.g., using seasonal indices).  
• Volatility is large month-over-month; consider stabilizing via promotions or smoothing product launches.  
• Year-on-year growth has flattened and recently turned negative; investigate market conditions/loss of major accounts.  
• For the next quarter, expect a flat baseline (~3.8 M per month) but plan for possible upticks if past seasonality holds (Mar–May rebound).  
• Longer-term forecasting should incorporate a seasonal ARIMA or exponential smoothing model to capture repeated patterns.

All enriched data and projections are available in the two CSVs listed above. Let me know if you’d like deeper drills (e.g., per-product contributions, channel breakdowns) or more advanced forecasting.

introspection_text = """1. What I Tried  
- Aggregation: Created `spain_segment_monthly_sales.csv` by concatenating monthly sales by segment_type (customer, city, family) from the filtered invoice-level data (2021–2023). Confirmed 21,580 rows.  
- Initial metric calculations: Attempted to load that file from `outputs/temp/...` and from `data/...` paths, repeatedly getting FileNotFoundError. Directory listing confirmed the CSV exists in `/data/`, not `/outputs/temp/...`.  
- Computed month_index, baseline means/stds for Oct and Nov (2021–2022), and current Oct-23/Nov-23 sales.  
- Defined a z-score function `compute_z` but code context misplaced its definition, causing NameError.  
- Calculated slopes via `np.polyfit` and rolling 12-month std.  
- Merged metrics into `detailed` and attempted to save as `segment_advanced_metrics.csv`.  
- Identified top 5 segments by abs(z-score) and abs(slope).

2. What I Know  
- Source invoice data: `/data/financials_final.csv` (Spain, 2021–2023).  
- Aggregated output: `/data/spain_segment_monthly_sales.csv` has columns: segment_type, segment_id, INVOICE_YEAR, INVOICE_MONTH, SALES_FUNCTIONAL_CURRENCY.  
- Target: compute z-scores (Oct-23 and Nov-23 vs 2021–22 baseline), regression slope (Jan-2021 to Nov-2023), and 12-month rolling std by segment.  
- Save results to `/outputs/temp/sales_report_country_Spain/segment_advanced_metrics.csv`.

3. What’s Missing or Blocking  
- Persistent NameError for `compute_z`: the function definition is inside a local block but then referenced outside. Code structure issues.  
- Rolling std calculation block had syntax errors from incorrect line breaks.  
- Confusion over correct file path: code attempted `/outputs/temp/...` but CSV lives in `/data/...`.  

4. Suggested Next Steps  
- Confirm and standardize file paths: load from `/data/spain_segment_monthly_sales.csv`, save to `/outputs/temp/...`.  
- Provide a single, complete code block that:
  a. Defines `compute_z` at the top-level before use.
  b. Uses unbroken, syntactically valid Python (no stray line continuation errors).
  c. Loads the CSV correctly.
  d. Computes z-scores, slopes, and rolling std in clear, sequential steps.
- Alternatively, load the CSV and print its head & dtypes to confirm structure before metric computations."""
